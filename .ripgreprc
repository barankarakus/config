# Ripgrep configuration
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# These options/flags are pre-pended to whatever arguments are explicitly given
# to ripgrep at the command line. Think of this as a way to supply a list of
# default arguments.
# Since later arguments take precedence over earlier ones, it's easy to overrule
# these default arguments on-the-fly.
# Note that the RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH enviroment variable must point to this file
# for ripgrep to be aware of it.
