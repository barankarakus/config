# List of plug-ins
# Note that this simply defines the list of plug-ins
# To actually install them, restart the shell session (or, source this
# file) and execute 'zplug install'
# Plug-ins are installed to the .zplug/repos directory

# Super cool command-prompt
# To reconfigure from scratch, run 'p10k configure' at the command line
# to launch the configuration wizard; the p10k function is brought into the
# namespace when the plugin is loaded (via zplug load, below)
# Configuration settings are stored in $CONFIGDIR/zsh/.p10k.zsh
# Strategy for configuring command-prompt:
# 1) Run configuration wizard to make it look like something you'd like
# (the individual icons etc will be customised at Step 2)
# 2) Edit the .p10k.zsh file to customise the individual items on the
# prompt, e.g. a section showing the currently active Conda environment

# Syntax highlighting for the shell, e.g. 'ech' at the command
# prompt will be red (because it's an unrecognised command) whereas
# 'echo' will appear green
