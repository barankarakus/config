This repo contains stuff related to my .zsh configuration.

To set it up from scratch:
1. Place this repo/directory at ~/.zsh (to be clear, not WITHIN ~/.zsh, but AS
~/.zsh).
2. Place a .zshenv file in your home directory containing the line
'export ZDOTDIR=path/to/this/repo'. This ensures zsh knows where to find the files
stored in this repo; by default, ZDOTDIR is not set, and zsh defaults to
looking in the home directory, where it'll find and load .zshenv.
An example .zshenv is in this repo, which also explains in more detail
why we need this step.
3. Follow the installation instructions for zplug and install it at
~/.zplug (which should happen by default).
4. Start a new shell process (or source .zshrc from the current one) and run
'zplug install'. Again, start a new shell process (or source...) and the
plug-ins should be activated.

NOTE: Things might not look pretty if the terminal running the shell
is not true-color or if the font isn't a Nerd font, because some of my
plug-ins (particularly the powerline10k command prompt plug-in) rely
on these.

Further information on my set-up:
- iTerm2 is my terminal emulator.
- I use the onehalfdark colour scheme (search 'onehalf colour scheme') for iTerm2.
- Within iTerm2, I use the font MesloLGS NF recommended by the
  powerlevel10k (a zsh plug-in for the command prompt) docs, where
  you'll also find installation instructions.
- I use zplug for zsh plug-in management, because it's simple,
  efficient, and
  transparent. I've tried oh-my-zsh and find it to be rather bloated.
- I use powerlevel10k to customise the command prompt.
  The file storing my configuration is .p10k.zsh.
- I use the zsh-syntax-highlighting plug-in, installed via oh-my-zsh,
  for, well, syntax highlighting.
- For more, see the .zshrc file.
